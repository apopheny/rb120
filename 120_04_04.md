What is the method lookup path and how is it important?

The method lookup path is how Ruby searches for method implementations for a given object. It begins in that object's modules, then its Class, then superclasses, working its way up. It is important because you may choose to override methods for a given object class, or, sometimes, sue the behaviors of its superclass using the `super` keyword.
